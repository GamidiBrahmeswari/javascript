DEFER ATTRIBUTE IN JAVASCRIPT:

The defer is a Boolean value, used to indicate that script is executed after the document has been parsed. 
It works only with external scripts (i.e., works only when we are specifying the src attribute in <script> tag).
 It declares that the script will not create any content.

 Difference between undefined and not defined:

 Undefined::
An undefined error is when we declare a variable in the code but do not assign a value to it before printing the variable.

Not defined
A not defined error is when we did not declare the variable and tried to call that variable.

Difference between var,let,const:

JavaScript var keyword
The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript. 
It has the Global scoped or function scoped which means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally,
 and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function. 


 JavaScript let keyword
The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. 
It is introduced in the ES6 or EcmaScript 2015. These variables has the block scope. 
It canâ€™t be accessible outside the particular code block ({block}).


JavaScript const
The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword,
 except the user cannot update it and have to assign it with a value at the time of declaration.
These variables also have the block scope. 
It is mainly used to create constant variables whose values can not be changed once they are initialized with a value.
